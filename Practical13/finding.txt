The resource of BLOSUM62 matrix can be found in:
Henikoff, S., & Henikoff, J. G. (1992). Amino acid substitution matrices from protein blocks. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 89(22), 10915-10919.

After executing the code, the results are: 
The BLOSUM62 score for human-mouse sequence alignment is: 3137.0
The BLOSUM62 score for human-rat sequence alignment is: 3107.0
The BLOSUM62 score for mouse-rat sequence alignment is: 3261.0
The higher the score is, the more similar the sequences are.

3107.0 < 3137.0 < 3261.0

So the conclusions are: 
Mouse's sequence and rat's sequence are most closely related.
Human's sequence is more closely related to mouse's than to rat's.
Mouse is a better model	organism for human based on the data analysed here.
