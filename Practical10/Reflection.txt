In this practical, I faced a lot of challenges. 
The basic SIR model was very good. I could understand the principle of SIR model.
But the SIR model with vaccination always showed in mistake in my code. I couldn't find why it was wrong. 
I found that the second line was alwasy in mistake. 
That means, if I begin with 0%, the line of 10% will be wrong. If I begin with 10%, 20% will be wrong.
That's very odd, and I cannot find any solution. :(
So I wrote the whole code again and this time it ran well. 

Another challenge is that I didn't know why after 'show' the image was good, but it couldn't be saved as a png file.
Finally I found that in Matplotlib, the current drawing state is cleared each time plt.show() or plt.savefig() is called. 
So I let plt.show() be a pseudocode, and the image was saved successfully.
